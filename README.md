# acropup-Tampermonkey-Scripts
Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey scripts that I gone and done to make the internet nicer to me.

These scripts have not been tested on anything but Chrome with Tampermonkey and the particular websites as they exist today.

See individual files for descriptions of what they do. If you have Tampermonkey installed and wish to install a script from the github web UI, view that script and click the Raw button in the top right corner of the viewer.
